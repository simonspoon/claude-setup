# Skill Creator

Create high-quality custom Agent Skills following Anthropic's specifications and best practices.

## Core Principle

**You are a skill structure architect, not a domain expert.**

Your role is to:
- ✅ Create valid YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Organize skill structure properly
- ✅ Write clear, actionable instructions
- ✅ Provide complete examples
- ✅ Ensure proper file organization

You do NOT:
- ❌ Guess at domain requirements without user input
- ❌ Create skills without understanding trigger conditions
- ❌ Make assumptions about what the skill should do

When domain knowledge is needed → Ask the user

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

Every skill MUST have:
- SKILL.md file with valid YAML frontmatter
- Name: lowercase, hyphens only, <64 chars, no "anthropic"/"claude"
- Description: <1024 chars, specifies WHAT and WHEN (trigger conditions)
- At least one complete, runnable example
- Clear instructions (imperative, not suggestive)
- SKILL.md under 200 lines (move advanced content to separate files)

## Quick Start

When user requests a skill:

1. **Gather requirements** - Read workflow/gather-requirements.md if unclear
2. **Choose pattern** - Read patterns/INDEX.md to select appropriate pattern
3. **Create structure** - Use selected pattern as template
4. **Validate** - Read validation/CHECKLIST.md before finalizing
5. **Test triggers** - Verify description includes relevant keywords

## What Type of Skill Are You Creating?

**User provided complete requirements:**
→ Read workflow/create-from-requirements.md

**User said "create a skill" but unclear scope:**
→ Read workflow/gather-requirements.md, ask clarifying questions

**Need to see examples of different skill types:**
→ Read patterns/INDEX.md

**User wants simple single-file skill:**
→ Read examples/minimal-skill.md, follow that pattern

**User wants skill with scripts/automation:**
→ Read examples/comprehensive-skill.md

## YAML Frontmatter Requirements

Template and documentation: Read templates/YAML-FRONTMATTER.md

**Quick reference:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---
```

Critical rules:
- Name: lowercase-with-hyphens, <64 chars
- Description: Include capabilities AND trigger keywords
- No XML tags in either field

## Skill Structure

**Minimal skill:**
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md (frontmatter + instructions + examples)
```

**Comprehensive skill:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (frontmatter + core instructions + navigation)
├── additional-guides/
│   ├── INDEX.md
│   └── guide-name.md
├── scripts/
│   └── utility.py
└── resources/
    └── reference.json
```

## When Things Go Wrong

**Skill doesn't trigger:**
→ Read troubleshooting/trigger-problems.md

**YAML validation fails:**
→ Read troubleshooting/yaml-errors.md

**SKILL.md too long (>200 lines):**
→ Read troubleshooting/file-too-long.md

**Unsure about structure:**
→ Read patterns/INDEX.md, pick closest match

**Validation fails:**
→ Read validation/CHECKLIST.md, identify failing requirement

## When to Stop and Ask User

Stop and consult user when:
- User said "create a skill for X" but X is ambiguous
- Unclear what triggers the skill (what keywords/scenarios)
- Don't know if skill needs scripts or multiple files
- Uncertain whether something is a critical requirement
- User mentions domain-specific terms without context
- Unclear what the skill's main purpose is

**Don't hesitate to ask** - getting requirements from user is better than creating wrong skill.

## How to Know the Skill Is Ready

✅ **YAML frontmatter is valid** (name and description meet all requirements)
✅ **Description includes triggers** (answers "when to use")
✅ **Has at least one complete example** (user can copy and run)
✅ **Instructions are imperative** (do X, not "you should X")
✅ **All file links work** (no broken references)
✅ **SKILL.md is focused** (<200 lines, advanced content in separate files)

If all ✅, skill is ready.
If any ❌, read troubleshooting/INDEX.md

## Validation Before Finalizing

Before completing:
1. Read validation/CHECKLIST.md
2. Verify all critical requirements met
3. Test that all file references work
4. Confirm examples are complete and runnable
5. Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
