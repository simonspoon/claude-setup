# Project Docs Explore

Orient yourself using a project's progressive-disclosure docs before writing code.

## Step 1: Check for docs/INDEX.md

Glob for `docs/INDEX.md` in the current working directory.

- **Found** → Continue to Step 2.
- **Not found** → Stop. This project does not use progressive-disclosure docs. Fall back to CLAUDE.md, README, and source code.

## Step 2: Read INDEX.md

Read `docs/INDEX.md` in full. It contains a table with columns like:

| Topic | File | When to read |
|-------|------|--------------|

This table maps doc files to task areas.

## Step 3: Match task to relevant docs

1. Identify your current task area (subsystem, feature, or concern).
2. Scan the "When to read" column for rows matching your task.
3. Read **only** the matching doc file(s) — not all docs.
4. If **no rows match**, proceed without docs — not every task has one.
5. If **multiple rows match**, read all of them.

Use doc content to inform implementation. Docs provide architecture context
and conventions but do not replace reading source code.

## Rules

- Read docs **before** writing code, not after.
- Do not modify docs via this skill — use `update-docs` for that.
